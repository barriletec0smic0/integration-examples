This Apache Camel application shows how DHIS2 resources, such as organisation units, can be mapped to FHIR bundles with [DataSonnet](https://datasonnet.com/) before being uploaded to a FHIR server like HAPI FHIR. In comparison to the `dhis2-to-fhir-bundle` example, DataSonnet provides template-based way to mapping resources.
